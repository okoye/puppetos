Puppet OS versions based on tinyos and contiki.

Current working version is contiki.

Brief Description:
Puppet OS Base
The contiki version provides support for a base sensing node that configures
the actual device, reads sensor values and writes to proxy for upload to
webservice. It also receives commands from proxy for execution on actual
device.

Puppet OS Proxy
Serves as the border router between 802.15.4 networks and 802.11 networks. It
also processes and relays messages from one web service to devices or from
devices to web service. In the former, it translates HTTP->COAP and latter
COAP->HTTP.
